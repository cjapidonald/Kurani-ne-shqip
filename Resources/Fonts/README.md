# Fonts

The Kurani app expects the **KG Primary Penmanship** font file to be available in this
folder as `KGPrimaryPenmanship.ttf`. The file is not included in the repository
because of licensing restrictions. After obtaining a valid license, drop the font
file into this directory before building the app so that the custom typography is
applied correctly.
